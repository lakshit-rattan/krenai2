caring for the old on the United Nations Population Fund's India Ageing

2
00:00:04,809 --> 00:00:05,280
Report.

3
00:00:05,289 --> 00:00:10,159
2023 India must attune its policies to ensure the elderly

4
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:11,560
live a life of dignity.

5
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:17,149
A good part of the world's population is growing older and India mirrors this

6
00:00:17,159 --> 00:00:18,030
trend as well.

7
00:00:18,729 --> 00:00:23,389
The reality According to the United Nations Population Funds India Ageing report

8
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:28,209
2023 is that the population above 60 years will double from 10.5% or

9
00:00:28,219 --> 00:00:32,770
14.9 grow as on July 1st 2022 to 20.8% or

10
00:00:32,779 --> 00:00:37,700
34.7 grow by 2050 with one in five individuals

11
00:00:37,709 --> 00:00:39,250
said to be a senior citizen,

12
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,520
there will be implications for health,

13
00:00:41,529 --> 00:00:43,080
economy and society.

14
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,319
In Kerala and West Bengal,

15
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:46,110
for instance,

16
00:00:46,119 --> 00:00:50,430
there is a growing population of the elderly who live alone as Children migrate for better

17
00:00:50,439 --> 00:00:51,400
opportunities,

18
00:00:52,319 --> 00:00:56,880
with life expectancy increasing thanks to better ways to fight disease and decreasing

19
00:00:56,889 --> 00:00:58,689
fertility rates In many countries,

20
00:00:58,700 --> 00:00:59,810
including India,

21
00:01:00,209 --> 00:01:03,569
there are challenges in nurturing and expanding elderly population.

22
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:06,220
Within this macro phenomenon,

23
00:01:06,629 --> 00:01:09,089
there are myriad other data of importance.

24
00:01:09,389 --> 00:01:10,489
For instance,

25
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:15,169
women elderly citizens outnumber their male counterparts at

26
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:19,459
60 years a person in India may expect to live another 18.3 years,

27
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:21,910
which is higher in the case of women at 19 years,

28
00:01:21,919 --> 00:01:24,319
compared to men at 17.5 years.

29
00:01:24,919 --> 00:01:29,900
If women in India their labour force participation is low at 24% do not have

30
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:31,730
economic and social security,

31
00:01:31,739 --> 00:01:33,959
they will become more vulnerable in old age.

32
00:01:34,629 --> 00:01:37,900
There are also significant interstate variations.

33
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:43,709
Most states in the south reported a higher share of the elderly population than the national average

34
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:48,580
in 2021 a gap that is expected to widen by 2036.

35
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:54,120
While states with higher fertility rates such as Bihar and Uttar Pradesh expect to see

36
00:01:54,129 --> 00:01:59,040
an increase in the share of the elderly population to by 2036 the level will

37
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:01,000
remain lower than the Indian average.

38
00:02:01,629 --> 00:02:02,339
Overall,

39
00:02:02,349 --> 00:02:05,139
more than 2/5 of the elderly are in the poorest wealth,

40
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:05,580
Quil,

41
00:02:05,589 --> 00:02:08,889
ranging from 5% in Punjab to 47% in Chattisgarh.

42
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:10,460
Also,

43
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:13,779
18.7% of the elderly do not have any income.

44
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:19,210
A high proportion of the rural population is among the elderly and often economically

45
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:19,919
deprived.

46
00:02:20,809 --> 00:02:23,660
To meet the challenges physical and mental health,

47
00:02:23,669 --> 00:02:25,410
basic needs of food and shelter,

48
00:02:25,419 --> 00:02:27,639
income security and social care.

49
00:02:27,979 --> 00:02:30,259
A whole of society approach is required.

50
00:02:30,869 --> 00:02:34,750
Geriatric care must be fine tuned to their unique healthcare needs.

51
00:02:35,619 --> 00:02:38,029
There are several schemes targeting the elderly,

52
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:41,550
but many are unaware of them or find it too cumbersome to sign up.

53
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:46,869
The national policy on older persons 1999 and the Maintenance and Welfare of

54
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:51,080
Parents and Senior Citizens Act 2007 laid down the care of the elderly.

55
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:54,000
But to ensure that senior citizens live in dignity,

56
00:02:54,009 --> 00:02:57,649
public and private policies must provide a more supportive environment.
